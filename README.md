# bamazon

This is a CLI App that acts like an Amazon storefront. The app will prompt the user to beging shopping
and display a table from a MySQL database that is populated with available items. 

When the user decides what they want to purchase they will be asked to enter the item id and the quantity
that they'd like to purchase.
